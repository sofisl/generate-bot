## Why

Read [Snapshot testing the hard way](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/snapshot-testing/)

I like [Jest snapshot](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html)
idea and want it without the rest of Jest testing framework. This module is
JUST a single assertion method to be used in BDD frameworks (Mocha, Jasmine)

Also, I really really really wanted to keep API as simple and as "smart"
as possible. Thus `snap-shot` tries to find the surrounding unit test name
by inspecting its call site
(using [stack-sites](https://github.com/bahmutov/stack-sites) or
[callsites](https://github.com/sindresorhus/callsites#readme))
and parsing AST of the spec file
(using [falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel#readme)).

Snapshot values are compared using
[variable-diff](https://github.com/taylorhakes/variable-diff) (objects)
and [disparity](https://github.com/millermedeiros/disparity)
(multi line strings). See [images/README.md](images/README.md) for screenshots.

This function also includes [data-driven][data-driven] testing mode,
similar to [sazerac][sazerac], see [Data-driven testing](#data-driven-testing)
section below.

## Example

Install: `npm install --save-dev snap-shot`

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot')
// in ES6 code use
import snapshot from 'snap-shot'
it('is 42', () => {
  snapshot(42)
})
```

Run it first time with `mocha spec.js`.
This will create snapshots JSON values file inside
`__snapshots__/spec.js.snap-shot`.
In general this file should close to Jest format, but the file extension is
different to avoid clashing with Jest persistence logic.

```sh
$ mocha spec.js
$ cat __snapshots__/spec.js.snap-shot
module.exports[`is 42 1`] = 42
```

Now modify the `spec.js` file

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot')
it('is 42', () => {
  snapshot(80)
})
```

```sh
$ mocha spec.js
1) is 42:
    Error: expected 42 got 80
```

**Note** `snap-shot` does not store or handle `undefined` values, since they
are likely an edge case. If you disagree, open
[an issue](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot/issues) please.

**Note** All values are saved as JSON, thus non-serializable values, like
functions are stripped before comparison.

## Promises

For asynchronous code, please have a function inside the spec before
calling `snap-shot` or let `snap-shot` wrap the promise.

```js
it('promise to function', () => {
  return Promise.resolve(20)
    .then(data => snapshot(data))
})

it('snap-shot can wrap promise', () => {
  return snapshot(Promise.resolve('value'))
})

// does NOT work
it('promise to snapshot', () => {
  return Promise.resolve(20)
    .then(snapshot)
})
```

In the last test, the stack trace from `snap-shot` cannot get any parent
information, thus it cannot find the unit test.

See [src/async-spec.js](src/async-spec.js)

## Jest

You can use this assertion inside Jest tests too.

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot')
test('my test', () => {
  snapshot(myValue)
})
```

## Ava

Should work (including `async / await` syntax), see
[snap-shot-ava-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-ava-test)
for the current status.

```js
import test from 'ava'
import snapshot from 'snap-shot'
test('concat strings', t => {
  snapshot('f' + 'oo')
})
```

## DOM testing (via jsdom and [jsdom-global][jsdom-global])

You can easily mock DOM and use snapshots (either in text or JSON format),
see [snap-shot-jsdom-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-jsdom-test)
project.

[jsdom-global]: https://github.com/rstacruz/jsdom-global

## React + JSX

If `snap-shot` finds `.babelrc` inside the current working folder, it will
try transpiling loaded files using
[babel-core](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/) API. This makes it useful
for testing React code. For full example see
[Link.test.js](https://github.com/bahmutov/snap-shot-jest-test/blob/master/Link.test.js)

## Showing snapshots when saving

If you just want to see what a new schema would be, without saving it,
run the tests with `DRY=1 npm test` option.

If you want to see the schema and save it, run the tests with `SHOW=1 npm test`

```
$ SHOW=1 npm test
saving snapshot "spec name" for file ./src/valid-message-spec.js
{ firstLine: 'break(log): new log format',
  type: 'major',
  scope: 'log',
  subject: 'new log format' 
}
```

## Update snapshots

To update all saved values, run with `UPDATE=1` environment variable.

```sh
$ UPDATE=1 mocha spec.js
```

To update snapshot inside a single test function, use second argument

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot')
it('is 42', () => {
  snapshot(80, true)
})
// snapshot file now has {"is 42": 80)
```

You can also update a single or several tests when running Mocha by filtering
the tests using [grep feature](http://mochajs.org/#g---grep-pattern).

```sh
$ UPDATE=1 mocha -g "test name pattern" *-spec.js
```

## CI

**Note** most CIs (like Travis, Circle, GitLabCI) define environment variable `CI`, which
we take into consideration as well. It makes no sense to allow saving snapshot on CI, thus if
the `process.env.CI` is set, the snapshot MUST exist on disk.

## Format

There is no magic in formatting snapshots. Just use any function or compose
with `snapshot` before comparing. Both choices work

```js
const snapshot = require('snap-shot')
it('compares just keys', () => {
  const o = {
    foo: Math.random(),
    bar: Math.random()
  }
  snapshot(Object.keys(o))
})
// snapshot will be something like
/*
exports['compares just keys 1'] = [
  "foo",
  "bar"
]
*/

const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
const upperCase = x => x.toUpperCase()
const upValue = compose(snapshot, upperCase)

it('compares upper case string', () => {
  upValue('foo')
})
/*
exports['compares upper case string 1'] = "FOO"
*/
```

See [src/format-spec.js](src/format-spec.js)

### General advice

Simple is better. Format the data and then call snapshot.

```js
it('works', () => {
  const domNode = ...
  const structure = formatHtml(domNode)
  snapshot(structure)
})
```

## Tests with dynamic names

Sometimes tests are generated dynamically without hardcoded names. In this
case SHA256 of the test callback function is used to find its value.

```js
// this still works
const testName = 'variable test name (value 30)'
const value = 30
it(testName, () => {
  // this is a test without hard coded name
  snapshot(value)
})
// snapshot file will have something like
// exports['465fb... 1'] = 30
```

The best strategy in this case is to use meaningful name for the callback
function

```js
const testName = 'variable test name (value 30)'
const value = 30
it(testName, function is30() {
  snapshot(value)
})
// snapshot file will have something like
// exports['is30 1'] = 30
```

See [src/unknown-name-spec.js](src/unknown-name-spec.js)

## Multiple snapshots

A single test can have multiple snapshots.

```js
it('handles multiple snapshots', () => {
  snapshot(1)
  snapshot(2)
})
it('uses counter of snapshot calls', () => {
  for (let k = 0; k < 10; k += 1) {
    snapshot(`snap ${k}`)
  }
})
```

See [src/multiple-spec.js](src/multiple-spec.js)

## Data-driven testing

Writing multiple input / output pairs for a function under test quickly
becomes tedious. Luckily, you can test a function by providing multiple
inputs and a single snapshot of function's *behavior* will be saved.

```js
// checks if n is prime
const isPrime = n => ...
it('tests prime', () => {
  snapshot(isPrime, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
})
```

The saved snapshot file will have clear mapping between given input and
produced result

```js
// snapshot file
exports['tests prime 1'] = {
  "name": "isPrime",
  "behavior": [
    {
      "given": 1,
      "expect": false
    },
    {
      "given": 2,
      "expect": true
    },
    {
      "given": 3,
      "expect": true
    },
    {
      "given": 4,
      "expect": false
    },
    {
      "given": 5,
      "expect": true
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

You can also test functions that expect multiple arguments by providing
arrays of inputs.

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
it('checks behavior of binary function add', () => {
  snapshot(add, [1, 2], [2, 2], [-5, 5], [10, 11])
})
```

Again, the snapshot file gives clear picture of the `add` behavior

```js
// snapshot file
exports['checks behavior of binary function add 1'] = {
  "name": "add",
  "behavior": [
    {
      "given": [
        1,
        2
      ],
      "expect": 3
    },
    {
      "given": [
        2,
        2
      ],
      "expect": 4
    },
    {
      "given": [
        -5,
        5
      ],
      "expect": 0
    },
    {
      "given": [
        10,
        11
      ],
      "expect": 21
    }
  ]
}
```

See [src/data-driven-spec.js](src/data-driven-spec.js) for more examples.

## Debugging

Run with `DEBUG=snap-shot` environment variable

```sh
$ DEBUG=snap-shot mocha spec.js
```

If you want to see messages only when new values are stored use

```
$ DEBUG=save mocha spec.js
save Saved for "is 42 1" snapshot 42
```

There are special projects that are setup to test this code in isolation
as dependent projects, see above.
